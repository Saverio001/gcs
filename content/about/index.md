Until 2022, we operated as the catch-all “Miscellaneous Operations Division” inside Frobozz Inc., the sprawling conglomerate best known for everything from industrial adhesives to cloud-adjacent software. While Frobozz chased vertical integration and proprietary innovation, our division quietly handled whatever the specialized units didn’t want: the cross-departmental paperwork, the inter-divisional hand-holding, the generic process that kept the lights on between breakthroughs.

When Frobozz’s board demanded “focus,” we saw opportunity. We spun out, rebranded, and doubled down on the one thing no one else would claim: absolute generality.

Today, General Corporate Services LTD. is an independent, privately owned entity serving only high-end corporate clients. We do not compete on niche expertise; we compete on general excellence—the disciplined, executive-grade execution of broadly applicable services that every large enterprise needs yet no one wants to own.

Our 1,400 employees operate from unremarkable offices in three time zones, delivering operational support, process orchestration, stakeholder facilitation, and compliance alignment at scale. We measure success not in disruptive metrics but in seamless continuation: another quarter closed, another integration survived, another firewall of bureaucracy navigated without fanfare.

Specialization fragments. Generality endures.

*"General Excellence. Exclusively Corporate."*
